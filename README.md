## General info

ai-mikey is a look back at my younger self. I munged data that I had saved for years from when I was a teenager to young adult from AOL Instant Messenger chat logs, LiveJournal posts, and comment/messages I sent on Facebook. I then trained a model using the GPT-2 algorithm and created this front end site designed as a AIM client on Windows XP so you could interact with the hosted model. This project was very insightful and actually healing for me to look back at my miserable teenaged past self and to really reflect and be proud of the person I've grown into today. Please revel in the cringe! Also feel free to send me screenshots or text that ai-mikey sends you. I will be documenting some of the more interesting things and sharing them in this readme soon (there's a lot of weird stuff in there). More css changes coming soon to get things looking more like AIM, plus draggable windows!
